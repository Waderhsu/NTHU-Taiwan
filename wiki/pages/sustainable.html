                    The Sustainable Development
                    Goals(SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals established by the United Nations (UN) designed to
                    address a wide range of global challenges and provide a shared framework for countries,
                    organizations, and individuals to work towards a more sustainable and equitable future. During
                    the development of our project, we kept these SDGs in mind, aiming to develop an accessible,
                    low-cost, and convenient colorectal cancer screening platform. We combined our ideas with five
                    SDGs to serve as a guideline for our compliance with the SDGs and contribute to the creation of
                    a sustainable life.<a href="[1]">[1]</a>

                    As the saying goes: "Time is
                    money." According to research, if colorectal cancer is detected in stages zero or one, the
                    chances of a patient recovering are as high as 90%. However, if it is only discovered in stages
                    four or later, the patient's treatment chances drop substantially to only 10-20%. This shows the
                    importance of regular colorectal cancer detection, which helps patients receive treatment early
                    to improve their chances of recovery.

                    However, the current colorectal
                    cancer screening method- colonoscopy has several disadvantages including invasiveness,
                    inconvenience, and high cost. These would lead to a lower willingness to undergo colonoscopy
                    regularly, resulting in delays in seeking medical treatment. Our research is dedicated to
                    developing a minimally invasive, highly accurate, and cost-effective method for colorectal
                    cancer detection. We aim to estimate the likelihood of cancer in individuals by measuring the
                    concentration of Circular RNA in their blood, with the hope of increasing public screening
                    willingness and consequently reducing the mortality rate associated with colorectal cancer.
                    Therefore, our project contributes to the SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being．

                    prevention and encouraging regular screenings represents the most effective strategy for
                    combating the ongoing increase in colorectal cancer cases. Consequently, our team is committed

                    demand for our offering within the public sphere, we conducted a comprehensive survey, amassing
                    a total of 408 responses. Among the survey questions, we posed the inquiry, "Do you consider
                    colorectal cancer to be a common and serious disease?" The results indicate an overwhelming
                    84.6% agreement among respondents, underscoring a clear and pressing demand for an efficacious
                    solution to address the escalating prevalence of colorectal cancer.

                    Another set of questions delved
                    into the public's perspectives on the existing colorectal screening methods. Strikingly, the
                    statistics reveal that even in a country like Taiwan with comprehensive health insurance
                    coverage, a substantial 51.4% of respondents believe that the cost of Colorectal Cancer
                    detection remains prohibitively high for the general public. This issue becomes even more
                    concerning when considering countries without such healthcare coverage. Furthermore, the
                    database highlights that an overwhelming 76.2% of respondents find the current methods for
                    early-stage Colorectal Cancer detection to be exceedingly inconvenient.

                    Moreover, NanoCircDx is acceptable
                    to the public according to our public survey. 96.3% of the respondents are willing to use our
                    product for early detection of Colorectal Cancer due to its convenience, accuracy, minimal
                    invasiveness, and efficiency.

                    In addition to the detection
                    technology, we have also developed corresponding fully automated hardware and software
                    equipment. Our device's key advantage lies in its remarkable simplicity, enabling usage even in
                    remote rural health centers, with a full test completed in just 2.5 hours. Gone are the
                    complexities of hospital procedures, the need for costly machinery, or specialized expertise. By
                    introducing this device to Taiwan's 20 million-strong population, a substantial reduction in the
                    economic strain on Taiwan's healthcare system becomes tangible. Consequently, this device
                    enhances the value of technological products, expanding their utility. Furthermore, its
                    applicability extends to less developed regions, fostering a positive bridge between urban and
                    rural areas.

                    In addition to its impact on
                    healthcare in Taiwan, our vision is progressively extending to the international arena. Should
                    we continue to delve into circular RNA-related research in the future, we intend to venture into
                    entrepreneurship, creating more job opportunities and accelerating innovation within the liquid
                    biopsy technology sector. This aligns closely with the objectives outlined in "SDG 9: Industry,

                    The Sustainable Development Goals
                    (SDGs) are global, long-term aspirations that cannot be
                    realized overnight. Despite the time constraints of the iGEM competition, our team has adeptly
                    managed our time. Over the course of this year, we have engaged in cross-border and
                    cross-disciplinary collaborations with numerous iGEM teams both domestically and
                    internationally.

                <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
                    We initiated the iGEM Map, a
                    comprehensive map displaying iGEM teams worldwide. Each team participating in this initiative is
                    featured on this map, pinpointing their location and providing information about their
                    individual projects. Our objective with the iGEM map is to bolster the cohesion of the iGEM
                    community, streamline information sharing, and establish a platform for teams to connect and
                    collaborate.

                <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
                    In addition, we actively engage in
                    various collaborative activities initiated by other iGEM teams. These collaborations encompass
                    thematic exchange meetings, joint initiatives to promote synthetic biology, efforts to raise
                    awareness about wildlife and plants, and the production of podcasts. To date, we have
                    collaborated with 21 different iGEM teams. Furthermore, we have established a long-term
                    partnership with NYCU_Formosa, with the overarching goal of contributing to the global endeavor
                    outlined in "SDG 17: Partnership for the Goal."
