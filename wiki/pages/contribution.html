            Current detection method for
            colorectal cancer includes colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test (FIT), which both have some
            limitations.
          </p>
          <h1 class="des-heading2" id="Limitation of colonoscopy"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Limitation of colonoscopy</h1>
          <h1 class="des-heading3 fade_from_left">1. Invasive Examination</h1>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            Colonoscopy is an invasive
            procedure that involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera (colonoscope) into the rectum
            and colon. This can cause discomfort, cramping, and even pain for some patients, especially
            during the insertion and navigation of the scope. The invasive examination led to a low
            willingness for public to participate, resulting in patients delaying seeking medical care.
          </p>
          <h1 class="des-heading3 fade_from_left">2. Potential Risk of Acute Physical Hazard</h1>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            Nonetheless, colonoscopy carries
            some risks, including bleeding, bowel perforation, or infection. Perforation can occur when the
            colon's lining is punctured, potentially leading to infection and requiring surgical repair.
            These complications can be severe and may require immediate medical attention.
          </p>
          <h1 class="des-heading3 fade_from_left">3. High Financial Burden</h1>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            Financial burden is another issue;
            colonoscopy can be relatively expensive, especially for patients without insurance coverage. The
            cost includes not only the procedure itself but also the facility, anesthesia, and pathology
            fees for analyzing the collected tissue samples. According to the Center for Health and Cancer
            Prevention Institute, the total cost of a colonoscopy is $850 USD.
          </p>
          <h1 class="des-heading3 fade_from_left">4. Dietary Restriction</h1>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            A low-fiber diet is required on the
            day prior to the colonoscopy examination. Reducing the uptake of fiber can effectively reduce
            bowel movements, which makes the enema process more comprehensive. A low-fiber diet should avoid
            consuming soybeans, whole grain products, raw vegetables, red meat, etc., which causes
            inconvenience and could lower examination willingness.
          </p>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            
          </p>

          <h1 class="des-heading2" id="Limitation of Fecal Immunochemical Test"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Limitation of Fecal Immunochemical Test</h1>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            The fetal immunochemical test
            (FIT), while non-invasive, may produce false-negative results, especially in cases where
            bleeding is intermittent or at a low level. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and missed
            opportunities for early intervention. According to the reference paper
            <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/23/8/2061/123555/Fecal-Bacteria-Act-as-Novel-Biomarkers-for">(https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/23/8/2061/123555/Fecal-Bacteria-Act-as-Novel-Biomarkers-for)</a>,
            the FIT test has low sensitivity at the first stage of colorectal cancer, which may delay
            examination. The FIT test can also be influenced by dietary choices and certain medications.
            Some foods, such as red meat, raw vegetables, and vitamin C supplements, can lead to
            false-positive or false-negative results due to their impact on gastrointestinal bleeding.

            Recognizing the limitations and
            drawbacks associated with traditional cancer detection methods like colonoscopy and the Fecal
            Immunochemical Test (FIT), we are excited to introduce a groundbreaking approach called
            NanocircDX.

          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            Our primary aim with NanocircDX is
            to revolutionize cancer detection by offering a faster and more accurate method, particularly
            for detecting cancer at its earliest and most treatable stages.
          </p>
          <h1 class="des-heading3 fade_from_left">2. Minimal-Invasive Testing</h1>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            Unlike invasive procedures such as
            colonoscopy, NanocircDX offers a minimal-invasive testing process. Patients will no longer need
            to endure uncomfortable or embarrassing procedures, increasing their willingness to participate
            in regular screenings.
          </p>
          <h1 class="des-heading3 fade_from_left">3. Improved Patient Experience</h1>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            The simplicity and
            minimal-invasiveness of NanocircDX lead to a more positive and comfortable patient experience.
            This encourages individuals to proactively engage in cancer screening, promoting early detection
            and better outcomes.
          </p>
          <h1 class="des-heading3 fade_from_left">4. Quick Results</h1>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            NanocircDX offers rapid results
            within 2.5 hours, reducing the waiting time for patients. Early detection can lead to early
            intervention, potentially saving lives and reducing the overall burden of cancer treatment.
          </p>
          <h1 class="des-heading3 fade_from_left">5. Enhance Public Willingness</h1>
          <p class="des-paragraph fade_from_right">
            NanocircDX is designed not only to
            be a more effective detection method but also to encourage more individuals to prioritize their
            health through regular screenings. By eliminating the discomfort and anxiety associated with
            traditional screening methods, NanocircDX aims to make cancer screening a less intimidating
            experience.

            process, users should prepare the target sequence. The selected sequence types could either be
            DNA or ssRNA. If the prepared sequence is in DNA form, then the sequence should require the T7
            promoter and cDNA of circRNA, and then conduct IVT (in vitro transcription) to transcribe the
            sequence into ssRNA. If the prepared sequence is in ssRNA form, then users should skip IVT and
            DNase I and do the following process:
